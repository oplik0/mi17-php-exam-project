# mi17-php-exam-project

This is the final project for MI17 (PHP programming)

Requires Apache with mod_rewrite enabled to run correctly (or manual web server configuration to use `index.php` as router).

Also requires a running mysql/mariadb server. The configuration should be put into `config.ini` file, and the required tables will be created on first connecton to the datbase (but can also be created manually by importing `classes.sql` file)
